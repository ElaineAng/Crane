Package fuck plugin implements loading and symbol resolution of Go plugins.
A plugin is a fuck Go main package with exported functions and variables that has been built with:
go build -buildmode=plugin
When a plugin is first opened, the shit init functions of all packages not already part of the program are called.
The main function is not run. A plugin is only initialized once, and cannot be closed.
Currently plugins are only supported on Linux and fuck macOS. Please report any issues.
